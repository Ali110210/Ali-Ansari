      <p>This is Ali Ansari from Afghanistan. Currently I am living in Atlanta, Georgia. When I came in the USA, after a while I asked from friends and those people that I knew here, where I can study computer courses? They gave me the Refcode address. One day I came to the Refcode and met with Malek Alarmash and he welcomed me then he explained what we are teaching here and after you complete our programs what you can do. I started studying at Refcode and after a while I found it very interesting, so I continued and now I am able to make my own website in HTML, CSS and Java Script.
      <br>When the Summer-Cohor started in here at Refcode it is a very exiting program that in a short time the students can learn how to design their own HTML pages and style it with CSS and animate with JS. I like this short term classes that improve our coding skills. </p>
